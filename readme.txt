CONTRIBUTIONS:
we have discussed about the problem and tried our own code achieve the 
solution for the program

1.M.SREE LAKSHMI :
Has contributed in includeing the file concepts and the operations on file.
she has understood about all the basic operations performed on files and
also the commands used for the operation on files.
and,helped in logic part of the program,have tried different ideas for solving the 
given problem.

2.LATHA.V
Has understood what outcome of the project has to be and has decoded the
logic part.and has checked errors and solved it

A textfile "input.txt" has to be created(in the same folder), in which the input data is stored prior the execution of the program. During the execution
of the program data is read from the file.


INSTRUCTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED DURING PROGRAM EXECUTION

* create a file,input.txt, before compiling the program.
* Enter the input in any order,including 1 and n,both
  after which the program is ready for execution.

PLEASE NOTE:INPUT FILE HAS TO BE RE-CREATED BEFORE EVERY EXECUTION FOR DIFFERENT DATA SET.


CHALLENGES FACED DURING THE COURSE OF THE ASIGNMENT

The major challenge faced was, how to implement the files concept.This was addressed by referring to PROGRAMMING IN ANSI C, BY E.BALAGURUSWAMY and browsing about the file concepts and the basic operations performed on files.


OUTCOME

We have learnt how to implement files in C-programming and how to perform operations on a file,and have also understood the usage of XOR in programming problems.
